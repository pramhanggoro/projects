Data processing for silicon-drift detector (SDD) characterisation by using a Fe-55 source.

1) Digital signal processing: waveform extraction of each channel (7 channels)
2) Full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) extraction by fitting two curves and comparing to reference value. This yields the energy resolution.
3) Combining spectra with histogram and attempting to reduce data noise.
4) Noise curve determination.
